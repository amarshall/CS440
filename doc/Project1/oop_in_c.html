    <p>
      This assignment is intended as a “warm-up” assigment
      to review C and C++,
      and to get you familiar with using UNIX, etc.,
      It is also designed to give you an idea of whether or not you
      wish to take this course.
      The topic of the assignment is how to do OOP in C.
      This will give you some understanding of what
      goes in behind-the-scenes,
      and also serve as a good review of C.
      A solid background in C will be necessary for the rest
      of the course.

    </p><p>
      The assignment is not to be completed in strict C,
      but rather more like C++ without classes.
      You may not use any C++ classes, inheritance, templates,
      or member functions.
      Also do not use any of the standard C++ containers
      such as <code>std::vector</code> or <code>std::list</code>.
      You may (in fact, you should) use C++ references.
      You must compile with <code>g++</code>, not <code>gcc</code>.
      I strongly suggest that you compile with <code>-Wall</code> to
      enable all warnings.
      Individual warnings that are not useful,
      such as warnings about unused variables,
      may be turned off individually (<code>-Wno-unused</code>).

    </p><p>
      You do not need to handle any error conditions not
      explicitly specified.
      For example, you may assume that the iterator
      returned by <code>end()</code>
      is never incremented.

    </p><h4>Part 1: Classes in C</h4>

    <p>
      For this part, you will investigate how to do class
      hierarchies in C.
      You must implement a base class named Person,
      a class named Student derived from Person,
      a class named Under derived from Student,
      a class named Grad derived from Student,
      and a class named Professor derived directly
      from Person.
      Note that no functions are available
      to the user to instantiate Person or Student,
      and thus the user cannot validly instantiate
      them.
      This is analagous to an abstract base class.
      Internally, you may define any functions you
      wish, but those would be private to your
      implementation.
      Of course,
      since C does not have classes,
      you will need to use a <code>struct</code> to represent the class.
      Requirements are given via usage in the <code>test.cpp</code>
      file which is linked below.

    </p><p>
      Note that to make this truly a class hierarchy,
      it must be possible for an external user to add
      a derived class without changing any code
      in the base class.
      To give yourself some assurance that you
      can indeed do this,
      after you are done,
      go through what you would need to do to add
      a Staff class, or a NonDegreeStudent class.
      If you would need to actually change any of
      the files you have already written,
      then you have not implemented those properly,
      and you will lose points.

    </p><p>
      For example,
      it would be incorrect to implement the <code>work()</code>
      method by checking the type of the Person inside of it,
      and printing the desired text.
      In such a case,
      adding another Person type would require that you modify
      the existing <code>work()</code> code,
      which would not meet the requirements.

    </p><h4>Part 2: A Container in C</h4>

    <p>
      For this part,
      you will use a macro to implement a template
      for a binary search tree container in C.
      As a template,
      it will be able to contain any type
      without using void * (which violates type safety).
      The requirements are again given via the <code>test.cpp</code> program,
      linked below.
      You are to write the macro so that this program
      will compile and run properly.
      You do <i>not</i> need to balance the tree.

    </p><p>
      You should use three struct types:
      one to represent the container itself,
      another for each element in the container (the node),
      and a third for the iterator.
      The struct type for the container itself would contain
      things like a pointer to the root node.
      The node struct type might have pointers to the children.
      The iterator struct type could contain just a pointer
      to the node that it is positioned at.

    </p><p>
      Since the container must have slightly different
      source code for each type,
      you cannot code it directly.
      Instead,
      you need to write a long macro,
      named
      <code>BinarySearchTree_DEFINE()</code>.
      The macro takes one argument,
      which is the contained type,
      provided as a typedef if it is not already
      single word.
      This macro will contain all the definitions
      needed for the container.
      By making the name of the contained
      type part of the generated classes and functions,
      a separate instance of the source code is generated
      for each contained type.

    </p><p>
      For example,
      the struct for a container containing
      <code>MyClass</code> objects would be named <code>BinarySearchTree_MyClass</code>,
      while the struct for a container of
      <code>int</code> variables would be named <code>BinarySearchTree_int</code>.
      A container for pointers to MyClass objects would be created by
      first defining a typedef:

    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>typedef MyClass *MyClassPtr;</pre>
    </blockquote>

      and then instantiating the container code by
      <code>BinarySearchTree_DEFINE(MyClassPtr)</code>.

    <p>
      I strongly suggest that you first do this part as regular code.
      When you are sure it is working,
      then convert it to a macro as the last step.
      Also, after converting it to a macro,
      save the original.
      If you find a bug,
      fix it in the original,
      then convert to a macro again.

    </p><h3>Submission and Evaluation</h3>

    <p>
      Your code must not have any fixed limits.
      For example, you must be able to accept Person
      names of any length.
      You must be able to construct the binary search tree
      with any number elements, etc.
      Your program must not have any memory leaks,
      nor any other types of memory errors, such
      as using data before it is initialized,
      writing to beyond a valid memory region,
      etc.
      Use the <code>valgrind</code> command to test
      your submission.

    </p><p>
      The test program for the assignment is
      <a href="http://cs.binghamton.edu/~kchiu/cs540/prog/1/test.cpp">here</a>.
      The output that you should get is
      <a href="http://cs.binghamton.edu/~kchiu/cs540/prog/1/output">here</a>.
      Your code must work with the unaltered
      <code>test.cpp</code>.
      (You are of course allowed to modify
      it on your own, as long as your submission still
      works with the unaltered version.)
      You should stress test your code,
      see the comment at the beginning of <code>test.cpp</code>
      for the options.
      We may also test your code with other test files,
      but we will conform to the API used in the
      provided <code>test.cpp</code> file.

    </p><p>
      The test program is provided as a means
      for you to check whether or not your program
      is as expected.
      It is NOT intended to be used to develop and debug your program.
      You may find it hard to understand, etc.
      Also, we may update the test program
      periodically.

    </p><p>
      You may of course develop your program on any
      machine,
      but it will be tested on the Linux classroom machines,
      and your grade will be determined by how it works
      on those.

    </p><p>
      You must divide your code up into three files:
      <code>Person.hpp</code>,
      <code>Person.cpp</code>,
      and <code>BinarySearchTree.hpp</code>.
      Your header files must have
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard">include guards</a>.
      Your submission must also include a <code>README</code>
      file which minimally contains
      at least your name and ID number.
      It can optionally contain any
      comments you feel are relevant to the project like what works,
      what does not work,
      what you feel is neat,
      logs of test cases, etc.

    </p><p>
      Your grade will be based on correctness.
      Correctness will include whether or not your output is correct,
      and whether or not you can scale, or have any memory
      (or other resource) leaks.
      Correctness will also depend on whether or not you
      have followed instructions, such as not using inheritance
      or member functions.
      If your code does not work correctly with
      the provided <code>test.cpp</code>,
      you must provide your own test code,
      which we will use to assign partial credit.
      Failure to do so will result in a low grade.

    </p><p>
      Performance will only be a factor for this assignment
      if you are unusually slow.
      <!--
      For comparison purposes,
      you can use the performance test program
      <a href="test_speed.cpp">here</a>.
      I would expect your solution to finish the
      test in about 5 seconds or less.
      I compiled with <code>-O</code>,
      and the resulting executable is
      <a href="test_speed">here</a>.
      (Remember to use "chmod a+x test_speed" to make
      the file executable after you download it.)
      -->

    </p><p>
      You must e-mail a compressed (gzip) tar file <code>YOUR_B_NUMBER_INCLUDING_THE_INITIAL_CAPITAL_B.tar.gz</code> containing
      the three files and the README to
      the class	<a href="mailto:cs540-internal@cs.binghamton.edu">internal mailing list</a>
      with subject set to “CS540 PROJ1 SUBMISSION”.
      The archive must not contain any executable or <code>.o</code> files.
      These will likely cause your submission to be rejected automatically by
      the e-mail server.

    </p><p>
      You will find that a makefile will make your life easier.
      A very simple makefile is given below:

    </p><blockquote><pre>PROJECT = YOUR_B_NUMBER
SRC_FILES = \
	main.cpp \
	...
	Makefile \
	README
a.out:
	g++ -g -Wall file1.cpp file2.cpp...

#Removes all objects and executables.
clean:
	rm -f  *.out *.o  core *.core *~

#This target makes a archive containing all the project source files,
#suitable for submission.
submit:	$(SRC_FILES)
	tar cvfz $(PROJECT).tar.gz $(SRC_FILES)
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Note the compile line must be indented with a real tab,
      and not just spaces.
