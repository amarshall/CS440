<!-- Fixes:
Clarify that namespace of "" is allowed.  Not sure about the spec.
Clarify (and fix solution) that only whitespace is
allowed after root node end-tag.  This is same as specification.
Clarify that interpunct is not actually in the XML.
It's just a meta-symbol.

Clarify that no need to parse URI internal.

Clarify that duplicate prefix is not allowed.

      <i>(This document was last modified on Saturday, October 22, 2011 at 08:47:46 PM.)</i>

    <hr>

    <p>
      The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use various features of
      C++ in practice,
      such as operator overloading, overloading
      <code>new</code>/<code>delete</code>,
      RTTI, and how to use the Visitor pattern.
      You may use any C++ features,
      including the Standard containers (STL).

    <p>
      The assignment is to write a parser for a
      simplified form of XML,
      containing only start-tags,
      end-tags,
      content,
      and namespaces.
      The format is given below,
      by example.

    <!-- Below XML is in sample1.xml -->
    <blockquote><pre>
&lt;elem1 xmlns:ns1="http://www.foo1.org" xmlns:ns2="http://www.foo2.org"&middot;&gt;
  This is some content.
  &lt;ns1:elem2 xmlns:ns1="http://www.foo.org"&middot;&gt;Content.&lt;/ns1:elem2&middot;&gt;
  &lt;ns2:elem3&middot;&gt;&lt;/ns2:elem3&middot;&gt;
  &lt;e3&middot;&gt;element3&lt;/e3&middot;&gt;
  Some more content.
&lt;/elem1&middot;&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The syntax <code>xmlns:ns1="http://www.foo.org"</code> binds
      the namespace prefix <code>ns1</code> to the full URI
      <code>http://www.foo.org</code>.
      Using the prefix <code>ns1</code> in front of an element
      name (with an intervening colon)
      defines the element in the namespace URI that has
      been bound to the prefix.
      The scope of a binding is the element within which it is
      defined,
      and any child elements.
      In the example above, 
      <code>elem2</code> is in the namespace <code>http://www.foo.org</code>.
      Note that a prefix may be rebound.
      Also, a prefix may be used by the element where
      the binding appears.
      An element can be in no namespace.
      The prefix used in the start-tag must be identical
      to the prefix used in the end-tag.
      Using a different prefix in the end-tag,
      even if it is bound to the same URI is not allowed.

    <p>
      Implementing namespaces will require a lookup
      table of some kind.

    <p>
      Element names and namespace prefixes will consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.
      URIs will consist of any valid character except double-quote.

    <p>
      White space may be present at a number of different points,
      as shown above.
      White space can consist of spaces, tabs, or newlines.
      Every instance of a space above <i>may</i> be replaced by <i>one</i>
      or more whitespace characters.
      Every instance of an interpunct <i>must</i> be replaced by <i>zero</i>
      or more whitespace characters.
      In other words,
      in the sample above,
      an interpunct has been placed at every point at which
      there could be one or more optional whitespace characters;
      and the interpunct itself is not part of the actual XML,
      it is only a symbol that I am using to indicate places
      where there may be optional whitespace.

    <p>
      Note that the content includes any and all whitespace.
      For example, the content of this element is exactly
      a newline followed by two spaces.

    <pre>
&lt;elem&gt;
  &lt;/elem&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      There will be no predetermined limits on anything.
      You will need to detect invalid input,
      but do not need any informative error message
      other than to indicate that the input is bad.
      You should not crash on invalid input.

    <p>
      My intent is that you do not need to actually
      refer to the XML specification,
      but for your reference
      it can be found <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/">here</a>.
      Note that it includes many things,
      such as processing instructions, comments, and entities,
      that you do not need to handle.
      You may also find the namespace specification useful.
      It is
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816">here</a>.

    <p>
      Some of you may find
      <a href="parser_example.tar.gz">this</a>
      example of a state machine useful.
      Note that this example also abstracts
      the input source.
      You do not need to do this.
      This example is just to teach you the concepts.
      You should NOT use it as basis to start
      this assignment,
      since it will likely lead you down the wrong path.

    <h3>DOM-Style Parser</h3>

    <p>
      Any XML parser needs to present its functionality
      via an API of some kind.
      One popular style is known as DOM,
      and outputs a tree-based data structure
      that represents the XML document as a tree
      of objects.
      DOM-style APIs are essentially data structures
      for tree-like data.
      They present the XML document as a tree of nodes.
      They provide a way of representing the document tree,
      and a way of traversing it.
      Note that an element may have two kinds of child nodes.
      The first kind is character content,
      which would be a string.
      The second kind is a child element.
      These kinds may be mixed within the children of a single element.

    <p>
      DOM-style APIs are normally also used for creating
      an XML document,
      but we will use it only to represent a parsed XML document.
      Thus,
      from the application's point of view,
      the output of your parser is read-only.
      An application may traverse the parser result either
      directly,
      or by using the Visitor pattern,
      as specified below.

    <p>
      The API you will need to implement is given below.
      You should put everything in the <code>xml</code> namespace.
      Note that you will certainly be adding additional
      things to the classes.
      The API only shows the public part.

    <p>
      For reference,
      you can look at the DOM (Level 1) API given
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/">here</a>.
      Wikipedia also provides a good
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">introduction</a>.
      Note that that you do not need to implement a full DOM API, so this is
      just if you are interested.

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="api">

    <h2><center>API</center></h2>

    <h4>Node</h4>

    <blockquote><pre>
class Node {
    public:
        <var>// Must be present, even if it does nothing.</var>
        virtual ~Node();
    public:
        ... <var>// You could add more to the public interface, if you wanted to.</var>
    private:
        ... <var>// Private things for your implementation.  Probably will not need</var>
            <var>// anything, since this primarily an interface class.</var>
};</pre>
    </blockquote>

    The above class is a base class.
    It is polymorphic,
    and so will work with RTTI.

    <h4>Element</h4>

    <blockquote><pre>
class Element : public Node {
    public:
        <var>// Returns the name of the element.  This is just</var>
        <var>// the part after the colon.  If there is no colon, then</var>
        <var>// it is the whole thing, of course.</var>
        const String &amp;name() const;
        <var>// Returns the full namespace URI (not the prefix) of the element.</var>
        <var>// If the element is not in any namespace, this should simply</var>
        <var>// return an empty String.  Note that 'namespace' is a reserved</var>
        <var>// keyword, so we don't fully spell it out.</var>
        const String &amp;nmspace() const;
        <var>// Returns the number of children nodes.</var>
        size_t n_children() const;
        <var>// Returns the i'th child.</var>
        const Node *child(size_t i) const;
        <var>// Accepts a visitor.</var>
        void accept(Visitor *) const;
        <var>// Convenience functions that internally will use RTTI.</var>
        static bool is_Element(const Node *);
        static const Element *to_Element(const Node *);
    public:
        ... <var>// You could add more to the public interface, if you wanted to.</var>
    private:
        ... <var>// Private things for your implementation.</var>
};</pre>
    </blockquote>

      The above class represents XML elements.
      It inherits from the <code>Node</code> class.
      RTTI can be used to distinguish an
      <code>Element</code> derived class
      from a <code>Text</code> derived class.

    <h4>Text</h4>

    <blockquote><pre>
class Text : public Node {
    public:
        <var>// Returns the text content as a string.</var>
        const String &amp;str() const;
        <var>// Convenience functions that internally will use RTTI.</var>
        static bool is_Text(const Node *);
        static const Text *to_Text(const Node *);
    public:
        ... <var>// You could add more to the public interface, if you wanted to.</var>
    private:
        ... <var>// Private things for your implementation.</var>
};</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The above class represents XML text content.
      It inherits from the <code>Node</code> class.
      RTTI can be used to distinguish an
      <code>Element</code> object from a 
      <code>Text</code> object
      when just a pointer to a Node is available.

    <h4>Parser</h4>
        
    <blockquote><pre>
class Parser {
    public:
        Parser(); <var>// Must be able to create one.</var>
        const Element *parse(const char *doc, size_t sz);
};</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      To parse a document,
      the user will first instantiate a <code>Parser</code> object.
      She will then call <code>parse()</code>
      and pass in the document in memory and its size.
      Your code must not modify the memory,
      of course.
      This method returns a pointer to the root
      <code>Element</code> object.

     <p>
      For example, if the input XML document is:

    <!-- Original is in sample2.xml -->
    <blockquote><pre>
&lt;e1&gt;&lt;e2&gt;Text1&lt;/e2&gt;Text2&lt;e3&gt;&lt;/e3&gt;&lt;/e1&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>

    then the resulting DOM tree will have a single root node named
    <code>e1</code> with three child nodes.
    The first child node will be an Element node <code>e2</code>.
    The second child node will be a Text node with <code>Text2</code>
    as the string.
    The third child node will be an Element node named <code>e3</code>.
    The <code>e2</code> Element node will have a single Text node,
    containing the content <code>Text1</code>, as a child.
    The <code>e3</code> Element node will have no children.

    <p>
      Deleting the root <code>Element</code> object will delete
      all child objects.
      Calling delete on any other <code>Node</code> object will result
      in undefined behavior.
      The application must guarantee that the document will be unchanged
      and persist as long as any <code>Node</code> objects or
      <code>String</code> objects
      associated with the document still exist.

    <h4>String</h4>

    <blockquote><pre>
class String {
    public:
        <var>// Copy constructor.</var>
        String(const String &amp;);
        <var>// Conversion to </var><code>std::string</code><var>.</var>
        operator std::string() const;
        <var>// Assignment.</var>
        String &amp;operator=(const String &amp;);
};
<var>// Comparison with </var><code>std::string</code><var>.</var>
bool operator==(const std::string &amp;, const String &amp;);
bool operator==(const String &amp;, const std::string &amp;);
bool operator!=(const std::string &amp;, const String &amp;);
bool operator!=(const String &amp;, const std::string &amp;);
<var>// Comparison with C string.</var>
bool operator==(const char *, const String &amp;);
bool operator==(const String &amp;, const char *);
bool operator!=(const char *, const String &amp;);
bool operator!=(const String &amp;, const char *);
<var>// Output operator</var>
std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;, const String &amp;);
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    The above is the string class that you should provide.
    Note that there is no need for a public constructor,
    though you would need a private (or undocumented one).
    Also,
    note that this string class will allow you to use
    optimized memory management.
    <!-- Note that copy construction and assignment are not
    part of the public interface. -->

    <p>
      You can assume that any String objects must be destructed
      before the Parser from where they came is destructed.

    <h4>Visitor</h4>

    <blockquote><pre>
class Visitor {
    public:
        virtual void start_element_visit(const Element &amp;) = 0;
        virtual void end_element_visit(const Element &amp;) = 0;
        virtual void visit_text(const Text &amp;) = 0;
};</pre>
    </blockquote>

    A application will derive a concrete class from the above
    abstract base class,
    and pass an instance of it to the root <code>Element</code>
    in the <code>accept()</code> member function.
    Calling <code>accept()</code> on anything other than
    a root <code>Element</code> results in undefined behavior.

    <p>
      After accepting a visitor,
      callbacks must be invoked on the visitor object in
      document order (depth-first).
      For example, consider the small application program
      below.
      All of this code is written by the application programmer.
      
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#include "Parser.hpp"
#include "Visitor.hpp"
#include "Element.hpp"
#include "Text.hpp"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

class MyVisitor : public xml::Visitor {
    public:
        virtual void start_element_visit(const xml::Element &amp;);
        virtual void end_element_visit(const xml::Element &amp;);
        virtual void visit_text(const xml::Text &amp;);
};

void
MyVisitor::start_element_visit(const xml::Element &amp;e) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Starting visit of element named \"" &lt;&lt; e.name()
         &lt;&lt; "\" in namespace \"" &lt;&lt; e.namspace() &lt;&lt; "\"..." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void
MyVisitor::end_element_visit(const xml::Element &amp;e) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Ending visit of element named \"" &lt;&lt; e.name()
         &lt;&lt; "\" in namespace \"" &lt;&lt; e.namspace() &lt;&lt; "\"..." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void
MyVisitor::visit_text(const xml::Text &amp;t) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Visiting text content \"" &lt;&lt; t.str() &lt;&lt; "\"..." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int
main() {

    xml::Parser parser;

    const char *doc = ...;

    xml::Element *root = parser.parse(doc, sz);
    MyVisitor v;
    root-&gt;accept(&amp;v);
}
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The above is the example of application code that would use your
      Visitor pattern implementation to traverse the DOM tree.
      Note that it is <i>application</i> code,
      not part of your parser proper.

      Your Visitor implementation should traverse every node starting
      from the root element
      and invoke callbacks on the passed in <code>Visitor</code> object.
      Using the code above,
      if the input XML document was:

    <!-- sample3.xml -->
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;r&gt;Text1&lt;ns1:c1 xmlns:ns1="URI1"&gt;&lt;/ns1:c1&gt;&lt;/r&gt;
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    then the sample application program above would print:

    <blockquote><pre>
Starting visit of element named "r" in namespace ""...
Visiting text content "Text1"...
Starting visit of element named "c1" in namespace "URI1"...
Ending visit of element named "c1" in namespace "URI1"...
Ending visit of element named "r" in namespace ""...</pre>
    </blockquote>

    </div>

    <h3>Optimized Memory Management</h3>

    <p>
      The API is designed to allow you to use
      your own optimized internal memory management.
      During our test,
      we will repeatedly parse many documents.
      After each parse,
      we will free the DOM tree.
      This will allow you to cache pre-allocated
      blocks of memory to be re-used.
      Note that there is no requirement that the
      internal representation in your string class
      actually use a null character to terminate
      the string.

    <p>
      You may find it useful to overload the <code>new</code>
      and <code>delete</code> operator,
      and use them to maintain class-specific free lists.
      When an object is freed with <code>delete</code>,
      it can be put on the free list.
      When an object is created with <code>new</code>,
      the free list would first be checked.
      If there is an unused memory block there, it should be used.
      If not, then global <code>new</code> should be called for memory.
      Thus, in this implementation,
      you should never call an un-overloaded <code>new</code> outside of these special
      functions.
      This is just an idea,
      feel free to be creative.

    <h3>Multicore</h3>

    <p>
      Parsing XML is not naturally amenable to parallelism,
      but if you wish, you may use a parallel parser.
      I can provide you with access to a multicore machine
      if you wish to do so.

    <h3>Submission and Evaluation</h3>

    <p>
      Some test code is available in
      <a href="test_code.tar.gz">here</a>.
      It includes:

    <blockquote>
      <p><code>parser_test.cpp</code>:
        Your parser should compile with this file without change.
        Your submission should also use this to generate
        the <code>parser_test</code> executable, as detailed below.

      <p><code>test{1,2}.xml</code>:
        These test your correctness.
        We have not intentionally withheld any correctness tests
        that we plan to do, but we reserve the right to add others.

      <p><code>bad.xml</code>:
        This contains examples of invalid XML that you
        should be able to handle.
        Do not crash on any invalid XML.

      <p><code>gen</code>:
        A document generator for performance testing is included.
        We currently plan to test performance with a document
        generated via something similar to:

        <blockquote><pre>
./gen testdoc.xml 4 6 0.25 <var>N</var></pre>
        </blockquote>

        where <var>N</var> will be adjusted so that the document
        is large, but the entire document will still fit in RAM.
        However, the exact format of the document may change slightly.
        For example, we may not use randomized element names
        for the final performance test for the contest.
        (So if you are using hashing,
        you will need to have a good hash function.)

      <p><code>sample_solution.{32,64}</code>:
        These are sample solution executables,
        compiled for 32-bit and 64-bit Linux.
        They will allow you to compare your output with what is
        expected.
        Your performance should also be on par with these executables.

      </blockquote>

    <p>
      Every class should have its own header file and implementation
      file.  The file names should match the class names exactly.
      You should provide a <code>Makefile</code> that, when run
      on the cluster of Linux machines provided for the class,
      will produce an executable named <code>parser_test</code>
      using the <code>parser_test.cpp</code> that we provided.
      Send the code as a tarball to the cs540 internal mailing list.
      Do not include any XML test documents or any object files or executables
      or core files.

    <p>
      Correctness will be evaluated mostly by <code>test{1,2}.xml</code> and
      <code>bad.xml</code>
      (though of course <code>bad.xml</code> will be broken
      out into separate files,
      so your executable won't terminate on the first error).
      We will also test to make sure that you don't have any static
      limits by trying things like very long element names, URIs, lots
      of namespaces, etc.
      We may add other correctness checks,
      though we don't have anything in mind right now.
      You should not have any memory leaks or other memory errors.
      You can check this with <code>valgrind</code> before submission.

    <p>
      We will evaluate your performance by repeatedly parsing
      documents and freeing them with a single Parser object.
      This will allow you to optimize your memory management
      internally.
      You can get full credit with performance that is similar
      to the sample solution executable provided.
      That solution uses a custom String implementation,
      but does no other custom memory management.

    <p>
      Performance will be evaluated on a 64-bit Linux machine
      with sufficient RAM.

    <!--
    <p>
      Your code must function correctly
      no matter what order 
      <code>Element::child()</code>
      is called,
      but when testing for performance,
      we will always call <code>Element::child()</code>
      in order,
      which will allow you to optimize how you maintain the list of children.
